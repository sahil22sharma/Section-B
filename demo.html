<p style="text-align: center;"><big>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large amounts of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.</big></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><big>Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. A region's climate is governed by latitude, but also 500pxelevation and proximity to moderating oceans. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.</big></p>
<p> <big>Its geographical features are</big></p>
<big>
<ul>
    <li>Mountains <br> <img src="https://cdn-academy.pressidium.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image_2021-12-27_074949.png" height="300px" width="500px"><p> A mountain is a landform that rises prominently above its surroundings, generally exhibiting steep slopes and a relatively confined summit area. It’s pretty rare for mountains to occur individually; in most cases, they are found in elongated chains or ranges. For example, the tallest mountain in the world, Mount Everest, is just one mountain in the Himalayan Mountain Range. Making up 20% of Earth’s landmass, mountains can be found on all seven continents.</p></li>
    <li>Plateaus<br><img src="https://cdn-academy.pressidium.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image_2021-12-27_075559.png" height="300px" width="500px"><p>Another feature of elevation is the plateau. A plateau is an area of highland that is raised significantly above the surrounding area. There are two major types: dissected plateaus and volcanic plateaus. A dissected plateau forms as a result of upward movement in Earth’s crust caused by the slow collision of tectonic plates, and a volcanic plateau is formed by several small volcanic eruptions that build up slowly over time. Although plateaus stand at a higher elevation than the surrounding terrain, they differ from mountain ranges in that they are remarkably flat.</p></li>
    <li>Mesas<br><img src="https://cdn-academy.pressidium.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image_2021-12-27_080001-1536x451.png" height="300px" width="500px"><p>Another flat-topped elevation is the mesa. A mesa is an isolated, flat-topped ridge or hill that is bounded from all sides by steep escarpments and stands distinctly above a surrounding plain. Mesas consist of flat-lying soft sedimentary rocks capped by more durable layers of harder rock. The durable layers act as a caprock that forms the flat summit.</p></li>
    <li>Valleys<br><img src="https://cdn-academy.pressidium.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image_2021-12-27_080524.png" height="300px" width="500px"><p>Lying in between some of these elevated structures are valleys. A valley is an elongated depression of Earth’s surface, commonly drained by rivers and occurring on plains or between ranges of hills and mountains. Deep valleys produced by the movement of tectonic plates are called rift valleys, while very narrow, deep valleys of similar appearance are called gorges.
    </p></li>
    <li>Plains<br><img src="https://cdn-academy.pressidium.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image_2021-12-27_080524.png" height="300px" width="500px"><p>Moving away from all the elevations and depressions, a plain can be described as any relatively level area of the Earth’s surface exhibiting gentle slopes and small local relief. Plains vary widely in size, with the smallest occupying around 10 acres, whereas the largest cover hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. The majority of the world’s most extensive plains were formed as a result of erosion and the deposition of soil and rocks as opposed to tectonic activity.</p></li>
    <li>Deserts<br><img src="https://cdn-academy.pressidium.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image_2021-12-27_080855.png" height="300px" width="500px"><p>One of the most widely variable geographical features, known for being some of the driest places on Earth, are deserts. Deserts can generally be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, which is less than 10 inches per year. This creates a harsh, arid climate that most plants and animals cannot survive in. Approximately one-third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid, including most of the polar regions, which are sometimes called polar deserts or cold deserts.</p></li>
    <li>Wetlands<br><img src="https://cdn-academy.pressidium.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/usgs-NhORwuiTg_U-unsplash-768x768.jpg" height="300px" width="500px"><p>As rivers empty their water and sediment into another body of water, wetlands known as deltas may begin to form. Other types of wetlands include swamps and marshes. The difference between these is most often defined by the vegetation that grows there. A marsh is a wetland that does not contain any “woody” plants, while swamps generally have woody plants and trees.</p></li>
